        Guernica is a platform designed for conflict artists from countries which are underrepresented

        in the art world. The reasons might be censorship from official art institutions, or difficult

        access to the web. This is why not all countries will be represented here â€“ but it means they get

        to be shown elsewhere!

        Guernica allows you to register as an artist and to showcase your work, connect with other

        artists, get commissioned and apply for competitions.<br><br>

        You can also register as a visitor and post competitions, donate to artists whose work you like

        and buy their work or commission an artist for a job.

        Guernica was created during the #peacehackLdn. Thanks to International Alert, Talking

        Peace Festival and Campus London for the opportunity!<br><br>
