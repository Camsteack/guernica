# Guernica

Guernica is a platform designed for conflict artists from countries which are underrepresented in the art world. The reasons might be censorship from official art institutions, or difficult access to the web. This is why not all countries will be represented here – but it means they get to be shown elsewhere! Guernica allows you to register as an artist and to showcase your work, connect with other artists, get commissioned and apply for competitions.

You can also register as a visitor and post competitions, donate to artists whose work you like and buy their work or commission an artist for a job. Guernica was created during the #peacehackLdn. Thanks to International Alert, Talking Peace Festival and Campus London for the opportunity!
